# Environment Troubleshooting

## Diagnose read-only first

Collect evidence before changing the environment:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
go version
go env GOROOT GOTOOLCHAIN
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN
lsof -nP -iTCP:8090 -sTCP:LISTEN
curl -i http://localhost:8090/api/v1/health
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'
```

Read `package.json`, lockfiles, `go.mod`, `.env.example`, Compose files, and the exact error.
Do not change `go.mod`, kill processes, delete `node_modules`, clear caches, or force dependency
resolution until the cause is confirmed.

## Common boundaries

- Frontend defaults to `3000`; backend defaults to `8090`.
- Browser API configuration uses `VITE_API_URL` (baked at build time) or the project's same-origin proxy.
- Production Compose must receive an explicit `--env-file`.
- Development and production containers may use different Docker networks.
- A listener on port 3000 may be an older Docker image rather than the checked-out frontend.
- Secrets belong in local environment files and must never be printed or committed.

## Recovery order

1. Correct the command/working directory.
2. Correct missing or invalid environment values.
3. Resolve the port owner or choose an explicit alternate port.
4. Confirm the running artifact matches the source before debugging already-fixed code.
5. Align the toolchain with the repository without weakening version requirements.
6. Use `npm ci` when the lockfile is authoritative; repair lockfile drift deliberately.
7. Verify dependent database/Redis/network health.
8. Re-run the smallest failed command and health endpoint.

Avoid `npm --force`, `--legacy-peer-deps`, global Go environment mutation, or broad cleanup as
default fixes.

## Docker verification

```bash
docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'
docker logs <container> --tail 50
docker inspect <container> --format '{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks}}'
```

If a protected browser flow cannot log in with documented seed credentials, classify it as
environment/seed drift until proven otherwise. Do not read or print environment secrets to
work around the failure; validate public endpoints and source/build layers independently.

Report the root cause, current service endpoints, exact remediation, and any remaining external
dependency.
